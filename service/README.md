This demo shows how to combine specific business in midway, giving full play to the charm of midway framework dependency injection and the ability of typescript type security.

This demo makes some changes to the code style: Take full advantage of the typescript type inference ability, avoid avoiding "interface hell"; avoid unnecessary intermediate variables, after all, the name is very tired one thing >_<

Midway: Based on eggjs, the biggest feature is the use of IoC mechanisms to manage application dependencies, developers can focus on truly complex business; thanks to Midway team support
